\section{Purpose}

The purpose of the model is to analyse the behaviour of an artificial society
populated by bandits, farmers, and soldiers based on policies that are taken
as parameters of the model

\section{Entities, state variables and scales}
\subsection{Entities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bandits: Steal resources from farmers to sustain themselves while trying
  to avoid soldiers.
\item Farmers: Gather food to sustain themselves and the soldiers by way
  of paying taxes while avoiding bandits.
\item Soldiers: Invest resources in the search for bandits to capture
\item Buildings: Store agent's resorces for latter consumption
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State variables}
Human agents
\begin{itemize}
\item Energy
\item Capcity
\item Occupation
\end{itemize}

Buildings
\begin{itemize}
\item storage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scales}
ticks 6 min
patch 1 kilometro cuadrado

\section{Process overview and scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
\item move
\item collect
\item switch-occupation
\end{itemize}

On each tick all the agents either move or collect depending on the patch that
they are and the energy available, then if the conditions are not favorable for
the agent then, based on a fixed probability, they choose to continue in their
current occupation or switch to another one.

\section{Design concepts}

\subsection{Basic principles}
all agents want to collect resorces, but not in a standard way
there is a finite amount of weight and energy that each individual can have

\subsection{Emergence}
the behaviour that emerge from the model are the agglomeration of agents
in some parts of the map

\subsection{Adaptation}
The agents adapt to their current situation by means of changing their
occupation if the conditions are unfavorable

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of the farmers is to collect as much resources as it can. In the
case of bandits is to steal such resources from farmers. And soldiers seek to
decrease the amount of bandits in the society. This objectives are affected by
each individual's state variables.

\subsection{Learning}
Learning capabilities of agents are not taken into account in this model

\subsection{Prediction}
Prediction procedures are not taken into account as part of the agent's behaviour
in this model

\subsection{Sensing}
Each agent can see other agents in their vicinity and can decide how to act
based on this knowledge

\subsection{Interaction}
Bandits assault farmers thus stealing all the resources they are currently
carrying. Soldiers capture bandits and try to convert them into farmers.

\subsection{Stochasticity}
The process in which an agent changes occupation is random and the success in
converting a bandit is also done randomly, which implies that each execution can
not be reproduced exactly

\subsection{Collectives}
Agents are divided in three groups that defines the behaviour they have to follow
and the way they are going to seek their objectives.

\subsection{Observation}
The variables that are necessary to know the current state of the system are
the population of each social group, the violence indicator and the capital flow

\section{Details}

\subsection{Initialization}
The position of all agents are chosen randomly, the amount of subjects per
social group is recived as parameter to the model as well as the probabilities
of switching current faction.

\subsection{Input data}
Besides the parameters specified previously the model has no input data that
is used during execution.

\subsection{Submodels}
Farmers move towards the nearest farm or city hall depending on the weight
they are carrying but if their energy is suffiently low they will decide to go home
to refill it. If there is a nearby bandit they will suspend what they are doing
to move to the nearest soldier in their field of view or given the lack of they
will move towards the city hall.

Bandits move towards the nearest farmer in their field of view trying to assault them,
if there is none then they will walk to the nearest farm or city hall. They will also
try to avoid any soldier. Finally if their energy is too low will return to their home
to refill it.

Soldiers move towards the nearest bandit in their field of view trying to convert
them into farmers, in the case there is none, they will move towards the nearest
farm or city hall, but if the energy they have is too low they will move towards
the nearest barrack to refill it.
